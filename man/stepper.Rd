\title{Stepper}
\usage{
make_stepper_basic(algorithm, abs_tol = NA_real_, rel_tol = NA_real_,
  ublas_state = NA)

make_stepper_controlled(algorithm, abs_tol = 1e-06, rel_tol = 1e-06,
  ublas_state = NA)

make_stepper(category, algorithm, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{abs_tol}{Absolute tolerance (see odeint docs for now)}

\item{rel_tol}{Relative tolerance (see odeint docs for now)}

\item{ublas_state}{Logical, indicating on whether the stepper
should use the internal data structures required by the stiff
systems.  This is likely to disappear soon, as it depends entirely
on the system itself.  The default, NA, will switch based on the
\code{algorithm} argument -- \code{rosenbrock4} is the stiff system
stepper.  However, to use other steppers with the stiff system, we
need to set up normal steppers similarly.  So probably at runtime
this will just rebuild the stepper for us.}

\item{category}{Either "basic" or "controlled"}

\item{algorithm}{The stepper algorithm (e.g. "runge_kutta4") - see
lists in \code{\link{stepper_algorithms}}}

\item{...}{Additional parameters passed from \code{make_stepper}
to either \code{make_stepper_basic} (none allowed) or
\code{make_stepper_controlled}.}
