R interface to [odeint](http://headmyshoulder.github.io/odeint-v2/downloads.html), using Rcpp for glue.

Pre-issues:

- [x] Decide on a better name? (actually keep this name and then we can have a logo which is a rat with an integral sign on its body)
- [ ] Decide on the version of odeint to target, and a mechanism for tracking upstream
- [ ] Implement all examples pointing at [BH](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/BH/index.html) to confirm that we have all the required headers, gather any others needed.
- [ ] Write simple handler for integrating derivatives written in R
- [ ] Extend to a C++ API that is accessible via include files.  This should be fairly straightforward given that odeint is header only.
- [ ] Benchmarks against gsl and lsoda - can use the gsl code in diversitree, and lsoda code in deSolve.
